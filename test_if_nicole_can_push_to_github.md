Hi Nicole, can you correct my speeling mistake, and add a sentance?

- Then save the file.
- Then click on the git button above > pull branches > close.
- Then click on the git button above > commit > add a check next to the listing for this file
- The changes (diffs) should be displayed: insertions in green, deletions in red 
- Add a description of the changes you made in the box to the right.
- Then push branches... if you see something like dd7e9f9..cb12102  HEAD -> main
at the end then it worked, you can close.
