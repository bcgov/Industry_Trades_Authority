Hi Nicole, can you correct my speeling mistake, and add a sentence?

- Then save the file.
- Then click on the git button above > pull branches > if it says everything up to date, you can close.
- Then click on the git button above > commit > add a check next to the listing for this file
- The changes (diffs) should be displayed: insertions in green, deletions in red 
- Add a description of the changes you made in the box to the right then commit > close > push
- If you see something like dd7e9f9..cb12102  HEAD -> main at the end then it worked.

**Always** do in this order: save file > pull changes >commit > push
