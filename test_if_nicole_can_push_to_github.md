Hi Nicole, can you correct my speeling mistake, and add a sentance?

- Then save the file.
- Then click on the git button above.
- Then pull branches, then close.
- Then commit, look for the file (it should have a blue M for modified beside it)
- Review the changes (insertions in green, deletions in red) 
- Add a description of the changes in the box to the right.
- Then push branches.
