Hi Nicole, can you correct my speeling mistake, and add a sentence?

- Then save the file.
- Then click on the git button above > pull branches > if it says everything up to date, you can close box.
- Then click on the git button above > commit > add a check next to the listing for this file
- The changes (diffs) should be displayed: insertions in green, deletions in red 
- Add a description of the changes you made in the box to the right then commit > close the box > push (green up arrow)
- If you get message HEAD -> main at the end,  it worked.

**Always** do in this order: save file > pull changes > commit > push
