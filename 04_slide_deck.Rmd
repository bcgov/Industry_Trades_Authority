## Highlights

- Comparisons to same month last year:
  - New apprenticeship registrations in `r max_date` were `r describe_change(get_growth(new_reg_total, years, 1))`.
  - Registrations in the Skilled Trades Certification (STC) trades occupations in `r max_date` were `r describe_change(get_growth(stc_new_reg, years, 1))`.
  - Certificates of Qualification issued in `r max_date` were `r describe_change(get_growth(cofq_app, years, 1))` for Apprentices.
  - Certificates of Qualification issued in `r max_date` were `r describe_change(get_growth(cofq_chal, years, 1))` for Trade Qualifiers.

- Forecast for next year:
  - Relative to last year, new apprenticeship registrations in `r year(today()+months(add_months))` are forecast to be `r describe_change(forecast_growth)`.

- People under 30 are those most likely to register for an apprenticeship.
- People of all ages were less likely to register for an apprenticeship in 2020. 
- For most age groups the proportion of new registrations has partially recovered from COVID.
- The exception is the 15 to 19 age group where the ratio is actually higher than pre-COVID.

## Appendix 1 {#A1}

- Source Code: [Github](https://github.com/bcgov/Industry_Trades_Authority)
- New apprenticeship registration forecasts are developed using the ratio of previous registrations to trades employment, which is applied to the forecast of trades employment from the last published edition of the BC Labour Market Outlook (LMO). 
- The current year forecast is a weighted average of new registrations thus far and the demand driven forecast described above.
- Historical data on New Apprenticeship Registrations and Certificates of Qualification was provided by the Industry Training Authority (SkilledTradesBC).
- Certificates of Qualification can be earned through two pathways: The completion of an apprenticeship program (Apprentice route, called “Apprentices”) or by challenging the certification exam (Challenge route, called “Trade Qualifiers”)

## Appendix 2: STC trades {#STC}

- These are the first 10 trades to undergo mandatory certification.
